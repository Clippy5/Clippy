# Clippy

# Product Vision

For internet users who find themselves having a difficult time organizing and discovering resources on the Web that sparks their interest, we introduce Clippy. Clippy is a social bookmarking service designed for users to explore and manage resources on the Internet. Users can immerse themselves in their own distraction-free space curated by them or explore resources gathered by others in the community. Unlike many other social bookmarking services, such as Pocket, Clippy is currently a free service made available to everyone.
