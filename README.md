# Clippy

# Product Vision

For internet users who find themselves having a difficult time organizing and discovering resources on the Web that sparks their interest, we introduce Clippy. Clippy is a social bookmarking service designed for users to explore and manage resources on the Internet. Users can immerse themselves in their own distraction-free space curated by them or explore resources gathered by others in the community. Unlike many other social bookmarking services, such as Pocket, Clippy is currently open source for anyone to adapt or use for themselves.

- [Requirements](https://trello.com/b/ui7fei2w/clippy)
- [Burndown Chart](charts/README.md)
- [Velocity Chart](charts/README.md)

## Task Allocation

Joshua Frazer - I setup the sub tasks and requirements for user stories on Trello. I also aided in creating multiple user stories which became of use for this week's sprint.

Jordyn Hayden - I setup my development enviornment by installing Visual Studio Code and .NET 5. I also created the API project which involved creating a blank .NET Core WebAPI project, adding an API status, swashbuckle dependency, .gitignore, and a README.md. I also setup a development server for the API where I installed the IIS and .NET Core hosting bundle, created the website, binded the domain to the website and installed an SSL certificate. Also, I installed an object-relational mapper, database migration files, and initial database. Finally, I aided in the creation of user stories and project documentation.

Jerrett Longworth - I created and refined the user stories for the project, as well as clarified the structure and format of the burndown chart.

Diego Rodrigues - I set up Visual Studio Code with multiple extensions for Javascript(React)/HTML/CSS for better productivity. Then, I created a new react-app, installed MaterialUI, and developed the website's static landing page. I placed the build on our server and configured it to output at the homepage. I finalized my tasks by contributing to the readme and other necessary documents.

Jaeivan Romero - I wrote the underlying code for our velocity chart and burndown chart using Python. I also slightly helped with the organization of user stories.

# Sprint 2

## Task Allocation

Joshua Frazer - I created complete UI Mockup of the Clippy website, incorporating the user stories from sprint 1 as a guide. I also revised the user stories by transitioning some of the requirements to separate cards while following the required format. In addition, I donated some time for project documentation such as the beginning of the high-level diagrams.

Jordyn Hayden - I created the ER diagram, helped with the development of the C4 Model, added to the UI mockup, and refined user stories and requirements.

Jerrett Longworth - I helped revise the user stories and requirements, worked on the high-level and class-level architecture diagrams, and worked on the system design document.

Diego Rodrigues - I contributed to the low-level UML diagrams by adding the React components and their functionalities. I also worked on the UI diagrams by creating pages and elements as well as its documentation. Finally, I created and edited the product demonstration.

Jaeivan Romero - I mainly worked on the first three levels of our achitecture diagrams and on the front end porition of the class-level diagram.
