# Clippy

# Product Vision

For internet users who find themselves having a difficult time organizing and discovering resources on the Web that sparks their interest, we introduce Clippy. Clippy is a social bookmarking service designed for users to explore and manage resources on the Internet. Users can immerse themselves in their own distraction-free space curated by them or explore resources gathered by others in the community. Unlike many other social bookmarking services, such as Pocket, Clippy is currently a free service made available to everyone.

## Task Allocation

Joshua Frazer - I setup the sub tasks and requirements for user stories on Trello. I also aided in creating multiple user stories which became of use for this week's sprint.

Jordyn Hayden - I setup my development enviornment by installing Visual Studio Code and .NET 5. I also created the API project which involved creating a blank .NET Core WebAPI project, adding an API status, swashbuckle dependency, .gitignore, and a README.md. I also setup a development server for the API where I installed the IIS and .NET Core hosting bundle, created the website, binded the domain to the website and installed an SSL certificate. Also, I installed an object-relational mapper, database migration files, and initial database. Finally, I aided in the creation of user stories and project documentation.

Jerrett Longworth - I created and refined the user stories for the project, as well as clarified the structure and format of the burndown chart.

Diego Rodrigues - I set up Visual Studio Code with multiple extensions for Javascript(React)/HTML/CSS for better productivity. Then, I created a new react-app, installed MaterialUI, and developed the website's static landing page. I placed the build on our server and configured it to output at the homepage. I finalized my tasks by contributing to the readme and other necessary documents.

Jaeivan Romero - I wrote the underlying code for our velocity chart and burndown chart using Python. I also slightly helped with the organization of user stories.
